**1. Can you differentiate between a List and a Tuple?**

Lists and tuples are Python data structures. The list is dynamic and whereas the tuple has static characteristics. They both have various advantages and use cases.

List
The list is the mutable data type, consumes more memory, and it is better for element insertion and deletion. Furthermore, it has several building functions, and the implication of iterations is slower compared to Tuple.  

Example:
```sh
a_list = ["Data", "Camp", "Tutorial"]
```

Tuple
The Tuple is an immutable data type, and it is generally used for accessing the elements. It is faster and consumes less memory, but it lacks built-in methods. 

Example:
```sh
a_tuple = ("Data", "Camp", "Tutorial")
```
